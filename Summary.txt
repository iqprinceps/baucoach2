Baucoach is a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend generated via Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. The project also uses Alembic for database migrations and includes several helper scripts for development setup.

backend/
- `main.py` – defines the FastAPI application and endpoints for PDF upload and prompting.
- `database/` – SQLAlchemy setup along with database models.
- `services/` – utility modules such as the OpenAI client and PDF parser.

frontend/
- React application bootstrapped with Vite.
- `src/` contains `App.jsx` and other entry files.
- Styled using Tailwind CSS as configured by `tailwind.config.cjs` and PostCSS.

alembic/
- Migration environment used by Alembic.
- `versions/` houses migration scripts, e.g. `8883df0de707_initial.py`.

prompts/
- Placeholder directory (currently only a `.gitkeep` file) for storing prompt templates.

Other notable files
- `requirements.txt` lists backend Python dependencies.
- `package.json` lists frontend dependencies and scripts.
- `setup.sh`, `setup_postgres.sh` and `run_backend.sh` are helper scripts for environment setup and running the backend.
